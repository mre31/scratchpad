A simple, professional plaintext editor. Tailored for users who prioritize a simple, efficient, distraction-free editor. It is also heavily customizable, so you can personalize it to your liking.

Made for Windows 10/11 and MacOS.

Linux is likely functional, however it is not officially supported. Linux binaries will not be released officially, so you will need to compile from source yourself to obtain a linux executable.

## Installation
See [Releases](https://github.com/ravendevteam/scratchpad/releases). Download the latest version for your platform (Windows or macOS currently available).

To compile from source, make sure you have Python 3.12.4 or greater, and PyInstaller, then run either `build.bat`, `build-macos.sh` or `build-linux.sh`, depending on your platform (Windows, MacOS, or Linux).

## Personalize The Editor

You can find community-made themes for your editor [here](https://github.com/ravendevteam/scratchpad-themes).

To personalize the editor, create **spstyle.css** in your user folder (*ex: C:\Users\Paul\spstyle.css*). Edit the file to include any CSS styling you want, save your changes, then restart Scratchpad. If done correctly, it should load your custom styling.

> [!NOTE]
> Scratchpad's UI is built with Qt5 (*PyQt5, to be specific*). You can read the documentation for Qt5 CSS styling [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html).
