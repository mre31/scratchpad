A simple, professional plaintext editor. Tailored for users who prioritize a simple, efficient, distraction-free editor. It is also heavily customizable, so you can personalize it to your liking.

Made for Windows 10/11 and MacOS.

Linux should be functional. Linux binaries will not be released officially however, so you will need to compile from source yourself to obtain a linux executable.

## Installing
Go to [Github Releases](https://github.com/ravendevteam/scratchpad/releases) and download the latest version for your platform. (Currently Windows or macOS)

To compile from source, make sure you have Pyinstaller installed, and then run either `build.bat`, `build-macos.sh` or `build-linux.sh`

## Personalize The Editor

You can find community-made themes for your editor [here](https://github.com/ravendevteam/scratchpad-themes).

To personalize the editor, create **spstyle.css** in your user folder (*ex: C:\Users\Paul\spstyle.css*). Edit the file to include any CSS styling you want, save your changes, then restart Scratchpad. If done correctly, it should load your custom styling.

> [!NOTE]
> Scratchpad's UI is built with Qt5 (*PyQt5, to be specific*). You can read the documentation for Qt5 CSS styling [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html).
