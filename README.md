A simple, professional plaintext editor. Tailored for users who prioritize a simple, efficient, distraction-free editor. It is also heavily customizable, so you can personalize it to your liking.

Made for Windows 10/11. Linux is likely supported but has not been tested.

## Personalize The Editor

To personalize the editor, create **spstyle.css** in your user folder (*ex: C:\Users\Paul\spstyle.css*). Edit the file to include any CSS styling you want, save your changes, then restart Scratchpad. If done correctly, it should load your custom styling.

> [!NOTE]
> Scratchpad's UI is built with Qt5 (*PyQt5, to be specific*). You can read the documentation for Qt5 CSS styling [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html).

## Roadmap

- config.txt for advanced customization
- Built-in encryption support
- "Import theme" option to easily import CSS styles from a URL
